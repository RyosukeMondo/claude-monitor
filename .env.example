# Claude Monitor Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to `.env` and adjust values as needed.
# Note: YAML config remains the primary source of truth. These env vars act as overrides where supported.

# Project path to be monitored (overrides monitoring.project_path in YAML when provided)
CLAUDE_MONITOR_PROJECT_PATH=/mnt/d/repos/miss_extension

# Spec name to be monitored (overrides monitoring.spec_name in YAML when provided)
CLAUDE_MONITOR_SPEC_NAME=clean-up-inject-favorit

# Delay in seconds before sending /clear after session start markers are observed
# Helps avoid racing against welcome banner rendering. Defaults to 5.0 if unset or invalid.
CLAUDE_MONITOR_BOOTSTRAP_CLEAR_DELAY_SEC=5

# Optional: Set Python logging level globally via YAML. Keep here for documentation.
# Actual logging level is configured in config/claude-monitor.yml under `logging.level`.
# Example values: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
# CLAUDE_MONITOR_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# TCP bridge host/port (documented; currently set via YAML under components.recovery_engine.tcp_client)
# To change host/port, prefer editing config/claude-monitor.yml.
# CLAUDE_MONITOR_TCP_HOST=localhost
# CLAUDE_MONITOR_TCP_PORT=9999

# Enable deep TCP communication tracing in YAML:
#   components:
#     recovery_engine:
#       tcp_client:
#         trace_communication: true
# This will produce per-message TX/RX/DONE entries with sequence IDs and exec correlation IDs.
