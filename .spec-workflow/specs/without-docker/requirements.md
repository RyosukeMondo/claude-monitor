# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "without-docker" feature enables the Claude Monitor Next.js application to run in standalone mode using `npm run dev` with file-based persistence instead of PostgreSQL and Redis containers. This feature addresses the need for simplified development environments, easier debugging, and reduced system dependencies while maintaining full application functionality. This transforms a Docker-first application into a flexible solution that can run on any development machine with just Node.js and npm.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports simplified development workflows by removing complex infrastructure dependencies, making Claude Monitor more accessible to developers who prefer lightweight setup processes. It enables rapid prototyping, easier debugging, and supports development environments where Docker may not be available or desired.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the Claude Monitor application with `npm run dev` without Docker containers, so that I can have a lightweight development environment without complex infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `npm run dev` THEN the application SHALL start successfully without requiring Docker containers
2. WHEN the application starts in dev mode THEN it SHALL automatically configure file-based persistence instead of PostgreSQL
3. WHEN no .env configuration exists THEN the application SHALL create a default .env.local file with appropriate settings
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL display clear startup messages indicating it's running in standalone mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database operations to work seamlessly with file-based storage, so that I can develop and test without setting up external databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs without Docker THEN the database SHALL use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL work identically to the containerized version
3. WHEN the application starts for the first time THEN it SHALL automatically create and seed the SQLite database
4. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL run automatically without manual intervention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time features to work without Redis, so that I can test WebSocket functionality in development without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the application SHALL use in-memory data structures instead of Redis
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL function identically to the Redis-backed version
3. WHEN the application restarts THEN temporary session data SHALL be gracefully handled
4. WHEN multiple browser tabs connect THEN real-time sync SHALL work across all connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want initial setup and configuration to be automatic, so that I can start development immediately without manual configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts for the first time THEN it SHALL auto-generate necessary configuration files
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the application SHALL create sensible defaults and log the actions taken
3. WHEN environment variables are undefined THEN the application SHALL use development-appropriate fallbacks
4. WHEN the setup process completes THEN it SHALL display a success message with next steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can easily diagnose issues and understand application behavior during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in dev mode THEN it SHALL enable debug-level logging by default
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full stack traces and context information
3. WHEN important operations happen THEN they SHALL be logged with timestamps and component names
4. WHEN log files are written THEN they SHALL be saved to a configurable logs directory
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log the current configuration and file locations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to and monitor Claude instances easily, so that I can test the monitoring functionality during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL provide clear connection setup instructions
2. WHEN Claude instances need to be configured THEN the UI SHALL offer helpful guidance and examples
3. WHEN connection tests are performed THEN the results SHALL be clearly displayed with diagnostic information
4. WHEN mock data is needed for testing THEN it SHALL be easily accessible through the UI

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle missing external dependencies gracefully, so that development can continue even when some features aren't fully configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external Claude instances are not available THEN the application SHALL continue running with mock data
2. WHEN file system permissions are insufficient THEN the application SHALL display helpful error messages
3. WHEN network connectivity is limited THEN local features SHALL continue to function
4. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the application SHALL provide clear installation instructions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Database adapters, WebSocket handlers, and configuration managers should be isolated
- **Modular Design**: File-based and container-based implementations should be interchangeable through configuration
- **Dependency Management**: Runtime mode detection should automatically select appropriate implementations
- **Clear Interfaces**: Database and caching layers should have consistent APIs regardless of backing store

### Performance
- File-based operations SHALL complete within 100ms for typical development workloads
- Application startup SHALL complete within 10 seconds on standard development machines
- Memory usage SHALL remain under 512MB during normal development operations
- WebSocket connections SHALL establish within 2 seconds

### Security
- Default configuration SHALL use secure settings appropriate for development environments
- File system access SHALL be restricted to the project directory and standard temp locations
- Environment variable handling SHALL prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data
- Local storage SHALL use appropriate file permissions (600 for sensitive files)

### Reliability
- Application SHALL auto-recover from file system errors where possible
- Data corruption SHALL be detected and handled gracefully with clear error messages
- Process crashes SHALL not leave corrupted state files
- Configuration validation SHALL prevent invalid states

### Usability
- Setup process SHALL require no more than running `npm run dev`
- Error messages SHALL provide actionable guidance for resolution
- Development tools SHALL be easily accessible through the web interface
- Configuration changes SHALL not require application restart when possible
