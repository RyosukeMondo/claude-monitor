# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docker Integration feature enables seamless containerized deployment and management of the Claude Monitor system with integrated Claude Code launcher capabilities. This feature transforms the current Python-based expect TCP bridge system into a TypeScript/Next.js native implementation, providing web-based Claude Code instance management and monitoring through Docker Compose orchestration.

The integration addresses three core components:
1. **Claude Launcher**: Native TypeScript implementation of Claude Code launching with TCP bridge functionality
2. **Claude Monitor**: Web UI for managing Claude Code instances, adding/removing sessions, and monitoring JSONL logs
3. **Docker Integration**: Complete containerization with automatic setup, installation, and configuration

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the project's core mission of providing comprehensive Claude Code monitoring by:
- Simplifying deployment through containerization
- Eliminating Python environment dependencies 
- Providing unified web-based management interface
- Enabling scalable multi-session monitoring
- Facilitating easy setup and configuration for new users

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Claude Code Launcher Service

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to launch Claude Code instances from the web interface with TCP bridge capabilities, so that I can programmatically interact with Claude sessions without requiring Python expect scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates Claude Code launch THEN system SHALL start Claude Code with TCP server listening on configurable port (default 9999)
2. WHEN TCP client sends commands to bridge port THEN system SHALL forward commands to Claude Code instance (send, enter, up, down, ctrl-c, tab, etc.)
3. WHEN Claude Code session starts THEN Claude Code app SHALL save session metadata to `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder-path-with-dashes}/{session_id}.jsonl` and system SHALL monitor file timestamps, updates, and contents
4. IF Claude Code binary is not installed THEN system SHALL provide clear installation instructions and validation
5. WHEN Claude Code starts for the first time in container THEN system SHALL handle authentication/login flow appropriately
6. WHEN session ends THEN system SHALL cleanup TCP server and log session termination

### Requirement 2: Web-Based Instance Management

**User Story:** As a monitor operator, I want to add and remove Claude Code instances from the web UI, so that I can manage multiple sessions without manual command-line operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks "Add Claude Instance" THEN system SHALL display project path selector and configuration options
2. WHEN user provides valid project path THEN system SHALL validate path exists and is accessible
3. WHEN user starts new instance THEN system SHALL launch Claude Code with monitoring enabled and display instance in dashboard
4. WHEN user stops instance THEN system SHALL gracefully terminate Claude Code process and TCP bridge
5. IF instance fails to start THEN system SHALL display error message with troubleshooting guidance
6. WHEN Claude Code requires initial authentication THEN system SHALL provide clear guidance for first-time setup in containerized environment

### Requirement 3: JSONL Log Discovery and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically discover new Claude Code sessions by monitoring the log folder, so that I can track all Claude activities without manual session registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new JSONL file appears in `~/.claude/projects/{project-folder-path-with-dashes}/` THEN system SHALL automatically detect and start monitoring file timestamps, updates, and contents
2. WHEN JSONL content is added by Claude Code app THEN system SHALL parse and display real-time updates in web interface
3. WHEN session ends THEN system SHALL maintain historical session data for analysis
4. IF JSONL parsing fails THEN system SHALL log error and continue monitoring other files
5. WHEN multiple sessions are active THEN system SHALL distinguish between sessions and display separately based on session_id and project path structure

### Requirement 4: Docker Compose Integration

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want to deploy the entire system using Docker Compose, so that I can easily set up Claude Monitor with all dependencies in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `docker-compose up` THEN system SHALL start all required services (app, database, optional Redis)
2. WHEN container starts THEN system SHALL automatically install Claude Code CLI if not present
3. WHEN container starts THEN system SHALL install spec-workflow MCP tools for enhanced functionality
4. IF Claude Code installation fails THEN system SHALL provide clear error messages and manual installation instructions
5. WHEN system starts THEN system SHALL mount ~/.claude directory for JSONL monitoring and persist database data
6. WHEN Claude Code runs for first time in container THEN system SHALL provide clear instructions for authentication setup and login process

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Claude Monitor behavior through environment variables, so that I can customize the deployment for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are set THEN system SHALL use provided configuration values
2. IF required environment variables are missing THEN system SHALL use sensible defaults and log configuration used
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN system SHALL apply changes without requiring container rebuild
4. WHEN system starts THEN system SHALL validate all configuration and report any issues
5. IF database connection fails THEN system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and clear error reporting

### Requirement 6: Claude Code Authentication and First-Run Setup

**User Story:** As a container user, I want clear guidance for Claude Code authentication when running in a containerized environment, so that I can successfully authenticate and use Claude Code without manual intervention issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude Code starts for the first time in container THEN system SHALL detect authentication requirement and provide clear setup instructions
2. WHEN authentication is needed THEN system SHALL display authentication URL and instructions in container logs and web interface
3. WHEN user completes authentication THEN system SHALL verify successful authentication before proceeding with instance launch
4. IF authentication fails THEN system SHALL provide troubleshooting steps and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN authentication is complete THEN system SHALL persist authentication state for subsequent container restarts

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate services for launcher, monitor, TCP bridge, and Docker management
- **Modular Design**: Claude launcher as independent service, reusable TCP bridge component, isolated monitoring logic
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize dependencies between launcher and monitor components
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean REST APIs for instance management and WebSocket for real-time updates

### Performance
- System SHALL handle up to 10 concurrent Claude Code instances without performance degradation
- JSONL monitoring SHALL process log updates with <100ms latency by monitoring file timestamps and changes
- Web interface SHALL update session status within 200ms of changes
- TCP bridge SHALL forward commands with <10ms latency

### Security
- TCP bridge SHALL only accept connections from localhost by default
- System SHALL validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Claude Code instances SHALL run with appropriate user permissions (not root)
- Environment variables containing sensitive data SHALL not be logged
- Authentication credentials SHALL be handled securely within container environment

### Reliability
- System SHALL gracefully handle Claude Code process crashes and restart monitoring
- TCP bridge SHALL reconnect automatically if connection is lost
- JSONL monitoring SHALL resume from last known position after restart by checking file timestamps and content offsets
- Container SHALL restart automatically on failure with exponential backoff
- Authentication state SHALL persist across container restarts

### Usability
- Installation process SHALL complete in under 5 minutes on standard systems
- Error messages SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting steps
- Web interface SHALL work consistently across modern browsers
- System SHALL provide clear status indicators for all running instances
- Claude Code authentication setup SHALL be clearly documented with container-specific guidance
