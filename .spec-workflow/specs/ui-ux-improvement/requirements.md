# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Monitor project currently has a robust backend API ecosystem including authentication, health monitoring, performance tracking, project management, sessions, recovery controls, and real-time socket communications. However, the frontend interface lacks comprehensive navigation, user experience design, and visual access to all available features. This specification outlines the requirements for a complete UI/UX overhaul that will transform the application into a professional, accessible, and user-friendly web dashboard.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This enhancement transforms Claude Monitor from a basic dashboard into a comprehensive monitoring platform that provides:
- Professional visual interface for all existing APIs
- Unified navigation experience across all features
- Enhanced user productivity through intuitive design
- Scalable UI architecture for future feature additions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Layout and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent navigation interface with sidebar menu and header, so that I can easily access all application features from any page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user loads any page THEN system SHALL display a fixed sidebar navigation menu
2. WHEN user loads any page THEN system SHALL display a header with logo, user info, and global actions
3. WHEN user clicks navigation items THEN system SHALL highlight active page in sidebar
4. WHEN user accesses application on mobile device THEN system SHALL provide responsive collapsible navigation
5. WHEN user hovers over navigation items THEN system SHALL show tooltips for better usability

### Requirement 2: Authentication UI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless authentication flows integrated into the main interface, so that login/logout actions feel natural and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is not authenticated THEN system SHALL redirect to login page with return URL
2. WHEN user completes login THEN system SHALL return to originally requested page
3. WHEN user clicks logout THEN system SHALL clear session and redirect to login with confirmation
4. WHEN user session expires THEN system SHALL prompt for re-authentication without losing work
5. WHEN user is authenticated THEN system SHALL display user info and role in header

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Overview Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive dashboard that shows system status, metrics, and quick actions, so that I can understand system health at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses dashboard THEN system SHALL display real-time health status from /api/health
2. WHEN user accesses dashboard THEN system SHALL show performance metrics with visual charts
3. WHEN user accesses dashboard THEN system SHALL display active projects and session counts
4. WHEN user accesses dashboard THEN system SHALL provide quick action buttons for common tasks
5. WHEN system detects errors THEN dashboard SHALL highlight issues with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual performance monitoring tools, so that I can analyze system performance through charts and metrics rather than raw API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses performance page THEN system SHALL display current metrics in visual format
2. WHEN user selects time range THEN system SHALL update charts with historical data
3. WHEN user requests load test THEN system SHALL provide intuitive controls and progress indication
4. WHEN user views benchmarks THEN system SHALL compare current vs Python implementation visually
5. WHEN user generates reports THEN system SHALL format data in readable tables and export options

### Requirement 5: Project and Session Management UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual project and session management interfaces, so that I can monitor, control, and analyze project activities through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses projects page THEN system SHALL list all projects with status indicators
2. WHEN user clicks project THEN system SHALL show detailed project information and active sessions
3. WHEN user views sessions THEN system SHALL provide session timeline and activity logs
4. WHEN user needs session details THEN system SHALL load session data with proper pagination
5. WHEN user performs recovery actions THEN system SHALL provide confirmation dialogs and feedback

### Requirement 6: Real-time Features Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates throughout the interface, so that I can see live changes without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes occur THEN system SHALL update UI components automatically via WebSocket
2. WHEN connection is lost THEN system SHALL indicate offline status and attempt reconnection
3. WHEN real-time updates arrive THEN system SHALL provide smooth visual transitions
4. WHEN user has multiple tabs open THEN system SHALL synchronize state across tabs
5. WHEN notifications occur THEN system SHALL display non-intrusive toast messages

### Requirement 7: Recovery and Control Operations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intuitive recovery and control interfaces, so that I can manage system recovery operations safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses recovery page THEN system SHALL show current system state and available actions
2. WHEN user initiates recovery action THEN system SHALL require confirmation for destructive operations
3. WHEN recovery operations run THEN system SHALL show progress indication and real-time status
4. WHEN recovery completes THEN system SHALL display success/failure status with detailed logs
5. WHEN user configures recovery settings THEN system SHALL validate inputs and save preferences

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with various devices and accessibility needs, I want the interface to work well on all screen sizes and be accessible, so that I can use the application regardless of my device or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses application on mobile THEN system SHALL provide touch-friendly interface
2. WHEN user accesses application on tablet THEN system SHALL adapt layout for medium screens
3. WHEN user uses keyboard navigation THEN system SHALL provide clear focus indicators
4. WHEN user uses screen reader THEN system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and structure
5. WHEN user prefers reduced motion THEN system SHALL respect accessibility preferences

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should focus on a single UI concern (navigation, dashboard widgets, forms, etc.)
- **Modular Design**: UI components should be reusable across different pages and contexts
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between UI components and external services
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean props interfaces and component APIs for maintainability

### Performance
- Initial page load time SHALL NOT exceed 2 seconds on modern browsers
- Real-time updates SHALL have latency under 100ms for local changes
- Chart rendering SHALL handle up to 1000 data points without performance degradation
- Image and asset loading SHALL be optimized with lazy loading and compression

### Security
- All API calls SHALL include proper authentication headers
- Sensitive data SHALL be masked in UI components (passwords, tokens)
- XSS protection SHALL be implemented through proper input sanitization
- CSRF tokens SHALL be included in all state-changing operations

### Reliability
- UI SHALL gracefully handle API failures with appropriate error messages
- Offline functionality SHALL maintain basic navigation and cached data display
- Component errors SHALL be contained and not crash the entire application
- State management SHALL persist critical user preferences across sessions

### Usability
- Navigation SHALL be discoverable with clear visual hierarchy
- Common actions SHALL be accessible within 3 clicks from any page
- Error messages SHALL be user-friendly and provide actionable guidance
- Loading states SHALL provide clear progress indication for operations over 1 second
